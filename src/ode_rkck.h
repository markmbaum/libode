/*
This class implements a 5th order method developed by Cash and Karp [1] which includes embeddes solutions of order 1, 2, 3, and 4. It's a complete family of solutions up to order 5. The lower order solutions can be used to vary the solution's order and control the step size in sophisticated ways, canceling a step early if the error estimate is large. The fact that function evaluations are made fairly evenly through the interval of a time step is also advantageous for surveying potential trouble and controlling the step.

So far, the sophisticated time stepping is not implemented, so this solver simply uses the 4th and 5th order solutions for adaptation.
